# Distributed Data

## Replication

Keeping a copy of the same data on multiple machines that are connected via a network. 

This helps:

- Keep data closer to your user
- Prevent system down
- Increase read output (can read from multiple places simultaneously)

1. Leader and Follower
   - Leader based replication: to ensure all replica has the data
     - The write request can only be sent to leader, who will then send write request to its followers
     - The read request can go to either leader or followers
   - Async vs Synchronous: whether the leader wait for follower to confirm before report back to client that the data is ready. 
     - If all sync: then if one follower fail, it will block any write requests to the leader
     - Semi-async: one is sync, so there are at least two copies of the data
     - All-async: can potentially cause data lost and the write is not durable
   - Create New Followe: standard file copy can not cover the data written to different part at different time
     - Setup regularly snapshot dump form the leader; when a new follower is added, it first copies the latest snapshot, and request the leader for all data changed since snapshot
   - Handle Node Outages:
     - Follower: it keeps a record of the last transaction it received from the leader, when it is back, it can request the leader for all data changed after the last logged transaction
     - Leader: promote one of the follower to a leader - failover
       - Determine the leader is down - use a timeout
       - Elect new leader - the one with the most up-to-date received from old leader
       - Reconfiguraiton - the system needs to treat the newly elected leader as the leader and the old one as not leader
       - Async replicate might be an issue - what if the old leader came back and the write keeps going, the new leader may recieve conflicting write request
       - Write data loss - consider if the leader increment some primary key that an external system use, the key will be out of sync when a new leader is promoted
    - Replication Log
  - WAL: store the data to be written in a log ahead, these are very low level data, will be hard to migrate to other system
  - Logical Log: store a sequence of statement, and these can be migrated to external application
  - Trigger-based: use an external application to sotre this
  - Problem with the log is - eventual consistency, especially async. 
- Anomaly:
  - Read-after-write Consistency:
    - When read somethign the user posts, only read form the leader, if only the user can post this information
    - If others can post information, use some metrics to determine whther to read from leader or follower (like if the follower is n minute behind the leader when you are trying to read at the nth minute after write)
  - Monotonic Reads: Read from same user should return consistent result, this can be achieved by user always reading from the same replica
  - Consisten Pre-fix Reads: if a sequence of writes happen in a certain order, then anyone reading those writes will see them appear in the same order
- Multi-Leader Pelication:
  - Multi-datacenter Operation
    - Every write processed in the local datacenter and is replicated async to other datacenter
    - Each data center operates indipendently
  - Client with Offline 
    - The local database acts as leader to access write and read
  - Handling Write Conflicts
    - sync write vs async: sync will basiclaly just block the second one until first one succeed; however, the async won't detect such discrepency until a later time
